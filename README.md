# Hospital Droid
HospitalDroid is a solution for indoor navigation for hospitals and end-to-end asset tracking in hospitals. This helps patients visiting the hospital to easily find their destination, even more so for disabled patients who can use the accessibility features of our app to figure out where in the hospital they are.


Instructions to run:

1. Install both the apks for both Navigation and Asset Tracking.
2. Beacons should be placed at differnt locations giving same major 2-bit value (e.g. 1100) and different minor 2-bit values (e.g. 2001) to perform the navigation operation.
